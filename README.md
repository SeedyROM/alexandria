## Why?

I've tried to write this in other languages and got my a** beat, 
so I'm doing it without any layer of abstraction or compiler helpers.

It's been tried in both Rust/Haskell and I met my match at the parser for the WAL...
So f**k it here we go.

## FAQ

Right now all this is, is the beginning of a storage engine for a persistent KV store.

## Tasks

- [x] WAL (Sort of... not fully tested)
- [ ] MemTable
- [ ] SSTable
